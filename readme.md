# Vitanet Server
This project is the server for the Vitanet game. It is derived from
an earlier simulation project which makes it very flexible for adding
actors, however it is not very optimized. In the current state only a
Player actor is present. It also renders the maps so the client doesn't
have to. Interaction with the client is pretty barebones right now
and a lot more actors need to be added before this can be called a game
and not just a chatbox.
